# The Simon Game

Welcome to **The Simon Game**! This project is a web-based implementation of the classic memory game, "Simon," built using JavaScript. The game tests your memory by having you repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Mimics the original Simon game, providing a fun and challenging experience.
- **Sound Effects**: Each color has a distinct sound, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game gets progressively harder as you successfully repeat sequences.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press any key on the keyboard to begin.
2. **Watch the Sequence**: The game will highlight a color, starting with one.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click the colors in the same order as the sequence shown.
4. **Progress**: If you get the sequence right, the game will add another color to the sequence. Repeat the process.
5. **Game Over**: If you click the wrong color, the game ends. You can then restart and try to beat your previous score.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
